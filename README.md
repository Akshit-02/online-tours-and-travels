# Online-tours-and-travels
This online Tours and Travels project, built using PHP and MySQL, serves the purpose of providing comprehensive information about available vehicles for various travel destinations. The system accommodates two main types of users: customers and travel agency employees. Firstly, customers visit the website and input their desired travel details, including the departure and destination locations, as well as their preferred travel date. This information is then sent to the travel and tourism agency. Subsequently, agency employees receive the inquiry and check for the availability of vehicles for the specified date. They then respond to the customer with a quotation based on the available options. If the customer accepts one of the provided quotations, they can confirm their booking by replying with their agreement.
